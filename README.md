# JS Bits

The first version:
![1.0.0](https://i.imgur.com/hDpzaze.png)

As I don't think this is ready for deployment, I don't want to pay the
$5 fee. You can still clone this and run it by following these steps:

1. Launch Chrome.

2. Type 'chrome://extensions' as the URL.

3. Choose 'Load unpacked extension.'.

4. Go to the directory where you cloned this file and select it.

You'll be able to use it now!

Let me know what you thought about it!
